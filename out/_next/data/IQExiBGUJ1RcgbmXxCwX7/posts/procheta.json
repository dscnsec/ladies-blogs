The difference is in <strong>when</strong> it generates the HTML for a page.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Static Generation</strong> is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at <strong>build time</strong>. The pre-rendered HTML is then <em>reused</em> on each request.</li>\n<li><strong>Server-side Rendering</strong> is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on <strong>each request</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Importantly, Next.js lets you <strong>choose</strong> which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a \"hybrid\" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.\nWe recommend using <strong>Static Generation</strong> (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.</p>\n<p>You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Marketing pages</li>\n<li>Blog posts</li>\n<li>E-commerce product listings</li>\n<li>Help and documentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should ask yourself: \"Can I pre-render this page <strong>ahead</strong> of a user's request?\" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Static Generation is <strong>not</strong> a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.</p>\n<p>In that case, you can use <strong>Server-Side Rendering</strong>. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.</p>\n","title":"Procheta","date":"2020-01-01","author":"Procheta Bhattacharyya","short":"it is a sample blog.","image":"https://procheta1999.vercel.app/photo.jpg","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/procheta-bhattacharyya-18890818b/","github":"https://github.com/procheta1999","mail":"mailto:bhattacharyya.procheta1999@gmail.com","twitter":"","portfolio":"https://procheta1999.vercel.app/","cover":"https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/02/75/11/41/240_F_275114154_XjA5hxmjz6wt0MRMrsCf8EyQEPsHZuxw.jpg"}},"__N_SSG":true}
